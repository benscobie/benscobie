### Hey ðŸ‘‹

I'm Ben, a software developer based in England.

I have been a professional software developer since 2013, with a passion for coding that began in 2005, starting my journey with PHP and VB.NET. My primary experience is with C#, React & TypeScript, but I love to tinker and learn new things. I also enjoy the "non-coding bits" like infrastructure, security, and observability. I'm a big fan of self-hosting everything ðŸ˜„.

### Projects

In addition to my own projects, some of which you can find below, I love contributing to the open-source ecosystem whenever I can.

My current focus is on [Maintainerr](https://github.com/Maintainerr/Maintainerr), a tool designed to simplify media management on your server by automating the handling of unwatched and requested media.
